bump: patch

Testing the release flow

- Created aggregate-changesets.sh: collects all changesets and determines highest priority bump type
- Created update-changelog.sh: merges changesets into CHANGELOG.md with version header and date
- Modified aggregate-changesets.yml: aggregates all pending changesets into single version bump, updates changelog, cleans up changesets
- Modified release.yml: uses version comparison (Cargo.toml vs git tags) instead of changeset checking - idempotent and race-condition free
- Eliminates race conditions by not pushing back to trigger branch
- Single version bump per release cycle instead of per feature
- Full changelog history preserved in CHANGELOG.md

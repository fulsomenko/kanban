Fix critical release workflow issues that prevented successful publishing to crates.io:

- Fix Nix script path resolution in publish-crates (validate-release now called directly)
- Use portable sed syntax compatible with both Linux and macOS
- Preserve .changeset/README.md when cleaning up changesets
- Correct changeset description parsing in update-changelog script
- Add runtime dependencies (cargo, git, grep, sed, find) to Nix shell applications
- Add concurrency control to aggregate workflow to prevent race conditions
- Remove error suppression that was hiding failures
- Extract repository URL from git remote instead of hardcoding
